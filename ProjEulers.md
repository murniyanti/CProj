# List of Questions from Project Euler



1. If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
   Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

   _answer:_ 233168

   ```c++
   int pEuler_Mul(int);
   ```

2. Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the  previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will  be:

   1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

   By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do  not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

   _answer:_ 4613732

   _notes:_

   Fibonacci is a natural's code. Means when observe number of flower petal, number of stigma or pineapple skin...its followed Fibonacci rules.

   By adding previous two numbers start with 0, 1

   0, 1, ...

   0+1 =1

   0, 1, 1...

   1+1=2

   0,1,1,2 ...



​	If  start with 1,2

​	1,2,...

​	1+2=3

​	1,2,3
